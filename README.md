# deepCCA
The method was coded in the course of my B.Sc. thesis titled "Deep CCA for Fusion of Brain Imaging Data". Major focus was related to recovering latent structures in data sets, which fulfill certain assumptions. Example.ipynb shows an example how deepCCA can be applied and compared to CCA.

*deepCCA* is implemented using PyTorch.
